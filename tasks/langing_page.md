# Building a landing page

Landing pages are static pages that entice someone to use your application.
Launchpad is a codelab, so let's not get too carried away.
For this exercise, try putting your own spin on the following:

1. Create a root page at `/` that displays a title for your new blog
2. Add a nice welcome message
3. People like pictures, so let them have a pretty image between the title and the message
4. Serve the image from launchpad

### Getting help
Take the next 30 minutes and read through the [Rails quickstart](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) if you're unfamiliar with Rails.
Alright, done?
Now, if you have any questions, please go to your onboarding buddy first, or ask a question in #product-dev.

Also, Google or DDG to get a quick sense for any terms or phrases that you're unfamiliar with.

#### Resources
1. [Rails routing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) Routing and controllers are an essential part of Rails, so take a moment to familiarize yourself if MVC frameworks are new to you or you haven't worked with Rails before.
2. [Rails controlers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html) Controllers are the C in MVC and are responsible for, well, controlling the effects of every single request to your server
3. [Rails views](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html) Once you understand how to get a request to some Ruby code you've written, take a look into wiring a view onto that controller
4. [Haml](https://haml.info/) is the flavor of markup we use for creating server-side rendered pages. It is less verbose than the standard ERB templating language in Rails, at the cost of looking less like HTML. However, it still does a good job of conveying a document's element hierarchy.
